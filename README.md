## Inspiration
We wanted to make something fun this weekend. So we made our own voice assistant - Zanie, and themed up the whole application with Arabian Nights vibes. Oh and Zanie, is our own genie!


## What it does

![New Project 6](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/69726390/117556980-2e157400-b08c-11eb-8784-fae987071c70.gif)

It's a voice assistant made on flutter. It can perform all the basic functions such as :-<br>
Respond to questions <br>
Open other apps on voice command <br>
Call people from contacts <br>
Message people from contacts <br>
Tell jokes <br>
Tell about himself <br>
..and more

## How we built it
We built the application on flutter, and have built an android apk for the same. Also, our introductory website is built using HTML-CSS

## Challenges we ran into
Integrating both Speech to Text and Text to Speech and synchronizing them to work together was indeed a tough task for us. That took most of our time to figure out. But in the end, we were able to do it successfully.

## Accomplishments that we’re proud of
We're proud that in 2 days, we were able to make a whole voice assistant from scratch, and we personally love the Arabian Nights and Aladdin vibes it gives. So much magic for the weekend!!

## What we learned
We learned a lot throughout the weekend. 3 out of 4 members of our team were totally new to flutter, so we really learned a whole new framework and enjoyed it pretty much.

## What’s next for Zanie - Voice Assistant
Well, making few improvements, adding customizable Zanie voice, we would definitely be deploying this app on play store and then in the app store in the near future!!
