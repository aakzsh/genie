## About Zanie
<center><img src="https://github.com/aakzsh/zanie/blob/master/assets/zanie.svg" width="40%"><center/>
<br>
Zanie is a mobile application built on the top of flutter to serve as a magically themed up voice assistant. For now, it can perform basic functions like answering to simple questions [not powered by ML yet], open another apps on command. <br>
We've planned bunch of more features like removing the QR Code scan thingy, letting users play some simple games to maybe earn coins, UI redesigning, adding ML and AI to let it answer questions and solving critical performance issues and more.
